        My Journey to CS
    </h2>

    <p1>
        Hello, my name is Nicole Lopez. I am 24 years old, senior at California State
        University Of San Bernardino. I picked the major because (mainly) I had to declare
        something. I figured, since I am constatnly on the internet I might aswell 
        do something with it. My road to computer sience is very boring. Shockingly enough,
        I didn't really learn how to code. Maybe it has to do with the classes that I took. 
        I am a transfer student, and I only took c++. 
        But when I started classes here (right when the pandemic started) my classmates 
        already knew 5 programming languages. The classes, hardly involved how to programm, 
        more so theory. Then I find out that my sister - who is studying crimonology- let 
        me know that she knew how to program python. I ask "how?" she said through her class. 
        That is the whole premise of it. "What, how come I didn't know" I really wanted to 
        learn python. She said, that some proffessors will hide the programming classes 
        so that computer science students wouldn't fill it. So, here I am a senior, bound to
        graduate in may with my programming skills fitting a beginner. I obviously did not plan
        everything well. However! I have ideas, and I was always heard you learn better doing 
        projects. This way you don't get stuck in a tutorial loop.

        I love to read. It is probably my only hobby besides rotting in my bed. But I 
        don't read self-help books. Nor educational books. You won't catch me reading 
        about AI on my down time. I (like majority of the girlies) love fantasy,
        romance, ya, science fiction, contemporary. Fun books, as I tell my father 
        whenever he asks me why I don't buy anything that will develop my mind / career. 
        Something about loosing yourself in a book just fills a void in me. When I downloaded 
        TikTok 3 years ago, I discovered booktok. I had maybe 85 books in my collection, 
        now it's <b>300.</b> Have I read evertyhing? Absolutely not. This year, I put myself 
        in a year long book buying ban. Booktok influenced me so much that I was just 
        buying and not reading. Book shopping is a whole differnt hobby. Although, I did
        make an exception to this buying ban for Cresent City 3. Been wating 2 years since
        that epic ending from book 2. Goal, is to read 100 books.

            Since I can't seem to think of something else to type, I would write about 
        my favorite books. This might be very basic, depending on what side 
        of tiktok your on. Let me start with (my) classics.  </p>

        I read all thoughtout high school. This had me and my friends in a chockhold. 
        A story involving angels, demons, werewolves, vampires, faeries. A girl 
        figuring out she is part of a race of shadowhunters that kills demons 
        to maintaing the balance on earth. While trying her hardest to rescue her 
        mother from the evil Valentine who is her evil biological father. 
        <i> Hush Hush Series </i> THIS WAS EVERYTHING in 8th grade. Paranormal romance 
        between a girl and a fallen angel. Funny, I re-read the first book a year ago, just 
        to reminsce and I was so <b> BORED </b>. The story was moving at a slow pace and quickly 
        put it down. <b> Current Favorites </b>, <i> Eliza and her monsters, 
            Kingfom of Ash, 
        </i>
        I think about these books all the time. Kingdom of Ash marks me <i>FINALLY </i> completing
        a series after 7 years of putting it off. Eliza, well that was the story I needed 
        after binge reading an authors entire book catalog for the month of January.
